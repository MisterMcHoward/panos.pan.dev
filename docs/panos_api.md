> When configuring and managing the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation firewall for scale and agility, it’s important to have a collection of powerful APIs and tools to automate activities and events. Our APIs and SDKs provide a collection of open, feature-rich automation opportunities for the beginning scripter and advanced developer alike.

#### REST API 
> The new PAN-OS REST API simplifies access to policy resources on the firewall as top-level URIs. You can use the API to create, change, and delete these resources directly on the firewall or from Panorama. <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-panorama-api/get-started-with-the-pan-os-rest-api.html" target="_blank">More information</a>

#### XML API
> A powerful low-level API that covers all the firewall's features. Take full control of every aspect of your security and build deep integrations with your systems. Make API calls directly on the firewall or from Panorama. <a href="https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-panorama-api/get-started-with-the-pan-os-rest-api.html" target="_blank">More information</a>

#### Device Framework SDK 
> Get automating faster with API libraries for Python and Go. Object-based interaction with the firewall in these language simplifies interaction with the firewall so you can focus on the automation itself. <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pandevice" target="_blank">Python</a> | <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango" target="_blank">Go</a>
